  bio: <p>Recording artist Vince Staples has come a long way from his trying upbringing in Long Beach, California’s Ramona Park neighborhood. Releasing his critically acclaimed debut <i>Summertime ’06</i> album in 2015, the then twenty-year-old saw his life turned right side up, going from being nearly trapped to having what appeared to be complete freedom.</p><p> Yet, as his most recent projects suggest, appearances can be deceiving. The LPs delves into the confusion of sudden fame and acclimating to a lifestyle antithetical to the one he’d known in Long Beach – one wrought with gang violence and poverty. It’s a fundamental narrative in hip hop, but rappers have always found a new way to breathe life into it. Staples brings forth a vision that’s brutal, elegant, playful, and despondent in one breath.</p><p> Such is the nature of his music, as self and socially aware as it is comical. With <i>FM!</i>, <i>Big Fish Theory</i>, <i>Prima Donna</i> and <i>Summertime ’06</i> behind him, Staples has set the tone for what’s yet to come. A standout rapper in today’s hip hop world, he keeps his sound deeply tied to his west coast roots and his message one that knows no boundaries.</p><p> In a world of full of painful departures, his art gives listeners reason to believe that, somehow, as he advances, the people who have left him and the people who he&#39;s left behind will still be waiting for him at the end.</p>

She stunned on the covers of NYLON and PAPER, and was named to the No. 4 spot on NPR's list &#34;The 21st Century's Most Influential Women Musicians,&#34; right behind Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Rhianna. Kiyoko made her national TV debut performing <i>Curious</i> on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and went on to perform fan-favorite <i>He'll Never Love You (HNLY)</i> on Late Night with Seth Meyers.
