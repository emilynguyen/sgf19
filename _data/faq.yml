- sectionTitle: Health & Safety
  questions:
    - q: What is being done to make the festival safe?
      a: <p>Student health and safety is the top priority of the festival organizers. The festival grounds are designed to be a safe space for students. Heightened enforcement will occur at festival entrances to prevent access to visibly intoxicated students and to block prohibited substances and items from entering the event. All attendees will be screened at the entrance, including a pat down and scanning of pre-registered UCSD student IDs, prior to admission. Similar to other large music festival entrances, drug recognition experts will be present to intervene with any intoxicated students, and security staff will use drug-detection dogs as a safety measure to ensure the festival is a drug-free space. Students who do show up under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be unable to enter the Sun God Festival. They also can be subject to arrest or other consequences related to violation of the UC San Diego Student Code of Conduct and/or taken to appropriate medical care.</p><p>As in years past, educational programs around the festival focus on key topics such as drug and alcohol safety and sexual assault prevention. In addition, the “floaties” bystander intervention training program has been expanded and student “floaties” who have gone through the training program will have a large presence at this year’s Sun God Festival. ASCE is also supporting other initiatives and groups on campus working to educate and support the development of students’ understanding of these issues.</p>
    - q: What happens if I show up to the event intoxicated?
      a: <p>To ensure the festival grounds are a safe space, students visibly intoxicated and under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be unable to enter the Sun God Festival. Heightened enforcement will occur at the festival entrance. All attendees will be screened, including a pat down and scanning of pre-registered UCSD student IDs, prior to admission. Similar to other large music festival entrances, drug recognition experts will be present to intervene with any intoxicated students, and security staff will use drug-detection dogs as a safety measure to ensure the festival is a drug-free space.

    - q: If I can't find my friend and they are not answering their phone, what can I do?
      a: <p>Call the Sun God Detox hotline at <a href="tel:858-246-0393">858-246-0393</a>. A volunteer will let you know if your friend is in Detox or if they have been taken to jail. Volunteers cannot disclose if your friend has been transported to the hospital.</p>
    - q: My friend just got taken to Detox! Where and when can I pick them up?

It takes about 20 minutes from the time a student is picked up before they are fully checked into Detox. Please note that if you call right away, there might not be a record of them yet.
