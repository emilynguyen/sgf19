      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The Sun God Festival is a student-curated, daylong music and arts
        festival at UC San Diego. Named as one of Live Nation’s “Top 5 College
        Concerts That Should Be Actual Festivals”, the Sun God Festival is
        continuously reimagined to deliver students with thrilling moments and
        life-long memories from live performances by national touring artists,
        diverse food vendors, vibrant art and décor, and interactive brand
        activations.

        2019 marks the 37th annual Sun God Festival. The tradition began in 1983
        when AS President Henry Chu, came up with the idea for a big bash after
        visiting UCLA’s spring festival. Although the first effort was
        unseasonably washed out and was canceled due to rain, Sun God shined in
        its 1984 re-debut and the festival has since become a beloved UCSD
        tradition. It has changed locations a number of times, from the original
        Student Center hump to the Sun God Lawn, to the Price Center plaza, to
        Warren Mall. Now it spreads its wings at RIMAC Field.
